## Overview
Cafe Menu is a simple point of sale system built in C++. It supports three key areas of an order transaction: menu management, order management, and order calculations.

## Organization
Cafe Menu is a combination of two separate libraries: cafe_menu_core (CMC) and cafe_menu_iostream (CMIO). CMC contains all the business logic, whereas CMIO only handles display input and output. Ex. CMC contains a function to calculate a total, whereas CMIO contains a function to display the total.

Cafe Menu is designed to be as modular as possible to give users the ability to easily incorporate other libraries. Instead of using CMIO to manage display prompts, users can use CMC with other graphics libraries to achieve a variety of display options.

It is important to note that CMIO is an optional library that provides an out of the box options to get users running as soon as possible.

## Quick Start
For ease, there is a dedicated namespace for accessing all the classes called cafe_menu.

## Continuous Integration
### Supported Environments & Compilers
CI workflows currently build and unit test on g++ (through Ubuntu), MSVC (through Windows), and Clang (through macOS).

## Requirements
### C++ Standard
C++ 11 is the minimum required C++ standard. However, C++ 17 is recommended as future versions will include C++ 17 features.

### Dependencies
Cafe Menu uses [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for dependency management in CMake. The build has been configured to download CMP from its GitHub repository if it is not already installed.

### Unit Test Dependencies
The unit test code uses [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git). If the 'CAFE_MENU_BUILD_TESTS' flag is provided to CMake the CMake configure / generate will download the Catch2. Note that v3 (or later) of Catch2 is required.

- Specific version (or branch) specs for the dependencies are in the [test/CMakeLists.txt](test/CMakeLists.txt) file, look for the `CPMAddPackage` command.

<!-- ## Generated Documentation -->
<!-- The generated Doxygen documentation for 'cafe_menu' is [here] (https) -->

## Build and Run Unit Tests
To build and run the unit test program:

First clone the `cafe-menu` repository, then create a separate `build` directory at the same directory level as `cafe-menu` but not inside the `cafe-menu` directory. 
- This "out of source" build allows for separation of the binary tree files (generated by CMake) and the source files (the `cafe-menu` directory).

Then, `cd` (change directory) into the `build` directory before using the following CMake commands:
```
cmake -D CAFE_MENU_BUILD_TESTS::BOOL=ON ../cafe-menu/

cmake --build .

ctest
```
#### Additional Commands
For additional test output, run the unit test individually, for example:
```
test/cafe_menu_test -s
```
To build the [example](example/cafe_menu_example.cpp), add `CAFE_MENU_BUILD_EXAMPLE::BOOL=ON` to the CMake configure / generate command.
```
cmake -D CAFE_MENU_BUILD_TESTS::BOOL=ON -D CAFE_MENU_BUILD_EXAMPLE::BOOL=ON ../cafe-menu/
```
## About Cafe Menu
Cafe Menu started out as a simple, single file programming exercise from a college course. It has now become a way to explore continuous integration (CI) and software design.
