# Cafe Ordering System

This is a basic food ordering system written in C++ and compiled with g++. A menu is generated with a small list of items. The user has the ability to select upto eight items. The user is also able to decide how many of each item they would like. After the user is done selecting items a final total cost is calculated.

## Future Functionality
- Update menu by adding and removing items dependant on the new menu.txt of that day
- Show running total of items and cost when user selects first item and until the order is complete
- Allow user to remove items from their order

## Integrations
- Create GUI with Qt and QML
